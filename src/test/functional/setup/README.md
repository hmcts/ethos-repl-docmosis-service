## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- [JDK 8](https://www.oracle.com/java)

### Building

The project uses [Gradle](https://gradle.org) as a build tool but you don't have to install it locally since there is a
`./gradlew` wrapper script.

To build project please execute the following command:

```bash
    ./gradlew build
```

To get the project to build in IntelliJ IDEA, you have to:

 - Install the Lombok plugin: Preferences -> Plugins
 - Enable Annotation Processing: Preferences -> Build, Execution, Deployment -> Compiler -> Annotation Processors
